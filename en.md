# What's happening in Japan

<small>

## Demand of Blazor was much increased 2022

</small>

One of common scenario:

- The developer works for implementing desktop application for the system inside a plant.
- They are facing new request that about monitoring system to see a status of plant operation for managers.
- Since the manager have to move around a lot during the job, they want a web application to access from anywhere.
- Performance is important.

# Today's Topics

- The reason why I recommend you Blazor as the web development framework.
- The points you should take care for web application as performance perspective.
- Let's start to create a new Blazor web application with performance tuning.
- What if more complex functional UI components are needed.

---

# Why you should choice Blazor

- You are C# developer.
- You are familiar with Blazor Server. (similar to client server model)
- You can create latest SPA web application.
- Document and showcase are incresing day by day.
- Microsoft is investing a lot to Blazor.
- A lot of library vendors were adopted Blazor including Infragistics.

# <!-- fit -->Three dimensions of web app performance

<small>

## 1. Load Time Performance

</small>

- How fast the web application load.
- For a desktop app, the time to excute application and be able to start interaction for user.
- To measure this performance, I suggest your use the "Lighthouse" (Chrome Extension).
- You should check "First Contentful Paint" metrics firstly.

# <!-- fit -->Three points of web app performance

<small>

## 2. Run Time Performance

</small>

- How responsive the web app is to user interactions.
- Chrome developer tools is good to identify performance bottlenecks.
- Some guidelines to improve run time performance:

    - Less than 1500 nodes in total. The maximum depth is 32 nodes. No parent node has more than 60 child nodes.
    - Properly size images, and lazy load images.

## 3. Soft Performance

</small>

This dimension is not easy to talk, hard to measure, this is related to User Experience for example:

- How easy it is for your user to find and navigate to the feature they want to use.
- How appealing the look and feel of your application is.
- How good the error messages your software produces to understand what the end user did wrong.

# Component Virtualization

Virtualization is a technique for limiting UI rendering to just the parts that are currently visible.

- You can use this technique for huge amount of looping content, like list, card, table.
- With calculating the position of scroll, just rendering necessary DOM inside a viewable area.
- When rendered DOM go outside from viewable area, it going to be destroyed.
- This is an out-of-the-box function for Blazor.

# To keep both functionality and performance is so difficult

- Feature request that never ends.

    - Sorting, Filtering, To register the short cut and so on.

- The difficulty of performance tuning increase for functional UI cotrols.
- Too hard to navigate the end user to each feature, easily produce bad user experience.
